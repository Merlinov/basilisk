# Basilisk

![finished basilisk keyboard picture](/images/finished3.jpeg)

Basilisk is an **ergonomic**, **split**, **40%**, **key-welled**, **handwired** keyboard.

It is programmed on two [WeAct RP2040](https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.RP2040CoreBoard) boards.\
It uses **TRRS cable** for communication between the boards.\
As the bottom-most thumb key each half has **Panasonic EVQWGD001** rotary encoder.

The case was designed in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview), and the archive files are in [fusion](/fusion/) directory.\
STL files can be found in [stl](/stl/) directory.\
Firmware was created using [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) and is stored in [qmk_firmware](/qmk_firmware/) directory.\
You can also find some more images, including the pinout schema I used when wiring the keyboard in the [images](/images/) directory.

### Why the name?

While designing it, the top view reminded me of the basilisk monster.
